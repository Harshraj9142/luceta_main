# Luceta - AI-Powered Audio Platform for Creators & Game Developers

## Business Overview

Luceta is a B2B/B2C audio platform that monetizes AI-generated audio through three revenue streams: subscription-based game development tools, NFT marketplace transactions, and enterprise API access. We serve two primary markets: indie game developers seeking affordable audio solutions and music creators looking to tokenize their work.

## Project Workflow

**1. Creator Onboarding** → Users connect their Web3 wallet and subscribe to a tier (Starter $9/mo, Pro $29/mo, Enterprise $99/mo) via Dodo Payments, unlocking platform features based on their plan.

**2. Audio Generation** → Game developers install the Luceta Godot plugin, which analyzes their game code using Groq AI, identifies audio needs, and generates contextual sound effects via ElevenLabs API - reducing audio production costs by 90%.

**3. NFT Minting** → Music creators upload tracks with cover art to IPFS (Pinata), mint ERC-721 NFTs on Ethereum, and list them on the marketplace with custom pricing - platform takes 2.5% transaction fee.

**4. Marketplace Trading** → Buyers browse NFTs with built-in audio preview, purchase using MetaMask, and receive ownership on-chain - smart contracts handle escrow and automatic royalty distribution to original creators.

**5. AI Support** → ElevenLabs conversational AI agent provides 24/7 customer support via voice chat or phone calls, handling onboarding questions, technical issues, and subscription management.

**6. Developer Testing** → Requestly mocks all external APIs (payments, blockchain, IPFS, AI) enabling rapid prototyping and demos without burning API credits or gas fees.

**Revenue Model:** Monthly subscriptions ($9-$99), marketplace transaction fees (2.5%), and enterprise API licensing for high-volume game studios.

**Key Metrics:** Reduce game audio costs by 90%, enable musicians to monetize work via NFTs, provide instant AI-generated audio in under 30 seconds.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js, Solidity, ElevenLabs, Dodo Payments, IPFS, Ethereum, Godot Engine - fully integrated end-to-end workflow from creation to monetization.
