# 🎬 30-Second Voiceover Script

---

## READ THIS IN 30 SECONDS:

"Luceta is an audio platform with NFT marketplace, Dodo Payments, and an AI voice assistant powered by ElevenLabs.

We used Requestly to mock FOUR different APIs:

One - Dodo Payments for subscription checkout.
Two - NFT marketplace listings and IPFS uploads.
Three - ElevenLabs TTS for our Godot game plugin.
Four - ElevenLabs Conversational AI - we built a custom support agent that can call your phone!

Eight rules total - response mocks, delays, headers, and error simulation.

The crazy part? Requestly lets game devs test AI voice generation without burning API credits, and we can demo the entire platform without any real backend calls.

Thanks Requestly!"
